To monitor server and service uptime, you can use a variety of tools and technologies. Here is an example of how to monitor server uptime using the Python programming language and the requests library:

This code defines a list of URLs to monitor and a function to check the status code of each URL. It then loops through each URL and checks the status every 60 seconds. If a URL is up, it prints a message saying that the URL is up. If a URL is down, it prints a message saying that the URL is down.

You can modify this code to suit your needs, such as adding email or SMS notifications when a server or service goes down, or integrating it with a monitoring tool such as Nagios or Zabbix.
